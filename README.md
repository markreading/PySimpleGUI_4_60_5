## PySimpleGUI Version 4.60.5

This is version 4.60.5, one of the latest versions before they made it license only.  If you want a nice gui package with no strings attached, here you are.

The developers of PySimpleGUI have pulled all older versions, opting for 'licensed' variant for versions 5 and above.

### How to install

Put these folders inside whatever coding directory you are using, or extract the PySimpleGUI.py file and use that only.

Or you can put all of these folders here:

Windows:
AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/Lib/site-packages


This should emulate as if it were installed by pip, as I just grabbed all the pysimplegui folders from there.
