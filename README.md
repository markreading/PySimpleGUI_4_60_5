## PySimpleGUI Version 4.60.5

This is version 4.60.5, one of the latest versions before they made it license only.  If you want a nice gui package with no strings attached, here you are.

The developers of PySimpleGUI have pulled all older versions, opting for 'licensed' variant for versions 5 and above.
I respect the effort and time put into the writing of this code, code I have found very useful during my time writing guis for testing hardware.
However, I disagree with the decision that a python package should need an account, license key, or even need to be paid for to use.
This kinda goes against what I understand as the idea of open-source, pip, and python.

### How to install

Put these folders inside whatever coding directory you are using, or extract the PySimpleGUI.py file and use that only.

Or you can put all of these folders here:

Windows:
AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/Lib/site-packages


This should emulate as if it were installed by pip, as I just grabbed all the pysimplegui folders from there.
